1. traffic driving efforts
	a) backlinks drive traffic and improve ranking
		reblog best posts, hackernews, chromeexperiments, medium.com, more... all
		https://envato.formstack.com/forms/create_a_tutorial?Source=&Medium=
		https://news.ycombinator.com/
		disqus.. probably garbage
		put examples on threejsorg
		contact influencers with plan (add to showcase or collaborate)
		create a medium publication?
		twitter, google plus, not sure about facebook
		need a product to sell... course on threejs is only way. one for developers. one for designers. one for managers

	b) only seo
		"featured snippet" h2 for list title, h3 for list items
		more images, bigger images, keywords... track rankings
		get ranked higher... seo, more copy on homepage
		ads brings traffic, but gone when campaign over, might increase backlinks...
	periods get interpreted as spaces
	"getting started with three js" 57, 54
	"three js world" 27, 38, 35
	"three js tutorial" 190, inf, inf
2. retention
	fix sharing system to increase signups

	alteredqualia, submitting on hackernews for 8 years... brea, CA
	mr. doob 16230 backlinks
	west langley, fucking weird
	marpi, la, sf, artist, dancing
	jerome 1427 backlinks, plugins site
	aerotwist
	benchung.com/category/three-js/ owns threejstutorials.com
	jaume @thespite
	cooper
	ee85


	deep market understanding
		most are very smart, like new features
		technical discussions on github (very much traffic?)
		mostly on twitter posting experiments

	promotion
	1 quick stackoverflow question
	each day, when you feel like it, send out a form email to showcase something

	threejs is a mess
	how can it compete with the likes of unity or unreal engine
	basics, create a github gist for getting started
	sections: home tutorials "free models" physics "free textures"

	sharing task
	views - show counter
	likes - use cookies to track history, store total in firebase
	shares - no counter
3. sustainability - make jekyll only process new stuff
