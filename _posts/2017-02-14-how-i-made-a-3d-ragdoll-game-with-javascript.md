I love animated violence. I find it's a great stress reliever.
While others do yoga or meditate, I prefer taking my frustration out on zombie hordes.
However, hurling your or your countryman's body down flights of stairs or impaling them with spears as digitized blood pours out and covers the whole playfield
has consequences IRL.

Which is why I made this game.
To bring you the joy of animated violence
